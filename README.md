**Dedupe** is a high-performance, memory-optimized Go tool designed to deduplicate URLs from a list. It supports filtering based on query strings, extensions, and more. Perfect for cleaning up large lists of URLs for web scraping, penetration testing, or bug bounty.

---

## Features

- **Fast and Efficient**: Built in Go for high performance and low memory usage.
- **Deduplication**: Removes duplicate URLs based on hostname and query parameters.
- **Filtering**:
  - Exclude URLs with specific extensions (e.g., `.js`, `.css`, `.png`).
  - Include only URLs with query strings.
  - Remove similar URLs (e.g., `/api/user/1` and `/api/user/2`).
- **Flexible Modes**: Enable multiple filters using the `--mode` flag.
- **Input/Output**:
  - Accepts URLs from a file or stdin.
  - Outputs deduplicated URLs to stdout or a file.
