**Dedupe** is a high-performance, memory-optimized Go tool designed to deduplicate URLs from a list. It supports filtering based on query strings, extensions, and more. Perfect for cleaning up large lists of URLs for web scraping, penetration testing, or bug bounty.

---

## Features

- **Fast and Efficient**: Built in Go for high performance and low memory usage.
- **Deduplication**: Removes duplicate URLs based on hostname, path (normalized), and query parameter keys.
- **Filtering**:
  - Exclude URLs with specific extensions (`-fe css,png,js`) or include only certain extensions (`-me php,js`).
  - Include only URLs with query strings (`-qs`).
  - Optional regex-based normalization (`-r`) treats integers and GUIDs in paths as placeholders, effectively deduplicating similar URLs like `/api/user/1` vs `/api/user/2`.
  - Optional language/country code normalization in paths (`-lc`).
- **Combine flags freely**: Toggle any combination without a separate `--mode`.
- **Input/Output**:
  - Accepts URLs from a file (`-i`) or stdin.
  - Writes to stdout or to a file via `-o`.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

# stdin â†’ file (Windows PowerShell)
type urls.txt | .\dedupe.exe -qs -o output.txt

# file â†’ file
dedupe -i urls.txt -o output.txt -qs

# exclude extensions
dedupe -i urls.txt -o output.txt -fe "js,css,png,jpg"

# include only these extensions
dedupe -i urls.txt -o output.txt -me "php,asp"

# normalize integers/GUIDs in paths (treat /1 and /2 as same)
dedupe -i urls.txt -o output.txt -r

# also normalize language/country codes in paths
dedupe -i urls.txt -o output.txt -r -lc
```

### Help menu
```
Usage:
